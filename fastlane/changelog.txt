This update brings a new navigation architecture, which is the groundwork for additional features like in-app linking and deep links. If there are any views that do not open correctly anymore or any new issues that seem releated to navigation, please let us know.

This update also has a new way to load challenge data, so please test that the challenge list still displays.
